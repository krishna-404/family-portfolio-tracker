 * Daily journal reminder — triggered by the reminder-dispatch cron
 * (apps/backend/src/cron_jobs/reminder_dispatch.cron.ts) when a user's
 * `journalReminderTimes` matches the current minute in their timezone.
 *
 * Push step fires an OS notification (if the user has push enabled);
 * In-app step is always visible in the Inbox bell regardless of push.
 * Both steps use the same payload shape (`title`, `body`) so the trigger
 * caller doesn't need to know channel-specific fields.
